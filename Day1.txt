1.) What is your understanding of blockchain?
    It is a constantly growing ledger which is distributed accross multiple systems and verified using cryptographic hash. It is immune to data manipulation since the data is validated using hashes.
    
2.) What are some core problems blockchain is trying to solve?
    It restricts frauds and develops trust in the system by making the ledger public and verifiable by all the owners.
    
3.) What are the few features which blockchain will give you?
    i.   Decentralized
    ii.  Immutable
    iii. Tamper-proof
    iv. Verifiable
    
4.) What all things does a Block contain?
    i.  Block Number
    ii. Previous Hash
    iii.Mining Key
    iv. Transaction Data
    
5.) How is the verifiability of blockchain attained?
    Verifiability is achieved by generating the hash of data stored and comparing with the hash generated by all the ledger holders.
